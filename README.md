# getting-and-cleaning-data-project
This is a project that is aimed to show the process of collecting, tidying and organizing data tought by the professors of this course. As a note to the viewers, please redirect your directory to your appropriate path before running the script.

##The R Script
The script goes as follows:
1. It sets the directory of choice (optional to you where you set your directory)
2. Downloads the zip file and unzips the dataset
3. Extracts only the mean and standard deviations from the training and testing datasets
4. Tidies up the data to make it more eligible by providing descriptive activity names to the activities within the datasets
5. Combines the datasets together based on activity names to create a text file called "tidy.txt"

The codebook will contain updates and modifications with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated along with other necessary information.
